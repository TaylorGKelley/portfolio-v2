# Overview

This is my portfolio website. It is coded in React.js using vite to build it as a lightweight, client side application. It is coded in typescript and will be the hub to display all of my future projects.

The design for the project can be viewed in Figma here(https://www.figma.com/design/Ayh3dxpJQ47pbHzclyVb2P/Portfolio-v2?node-id=9-2&t=CWblZhyEeceWz1k7-1)!

## Purpose

This website is to act as my resume for potential job offers 🙃
