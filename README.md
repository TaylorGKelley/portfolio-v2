# Overview
This is my portfolio website. It is coded in React.js using vite to build it as a lightweight, client side application. It is coded in typescript and will be the hub to display all of my future projects. 

The design for the project can be viewed in Figma here(https://www.figma.com/design/Ayh3dxpJQ47pbHzclyVb2P/Portfolio-v2?node-id=9-2&t=CWblZhyEeceWz1k7-1)!

## Purpose
This website is to act as my resume for potential job offers ðŸ™ƒ

### The Second version
It is the second version of portfolios I have made, as the first version was a very simple, a single page with vanilla JS made 2 years ago. This code was lost as it was not stored in github.
